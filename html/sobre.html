      <blockquote>
        The struggle is approaching its denouement, the answer to the question
        whether actual power is to remain with the tsar's government. As for
        recognition of the revolution, it has now been generally recognised. It
        was recognised quite long ago by Mr. Struve and the Osvobozhdeniye
        gentry. It is now recognised by Mr. Witte and by Nicholas Romanov.
        <q>I promise you anything you wish</q>, says the tsar,
        <q>only let me retain power, let me fulfil my own promises</q>. That is
        the gist of the tsar's Manifesto, and it obviously had to spark off a
        determined struggle. <q>I grant you everything except power</q>, tsarism
        declares. <strong>Everything is illusory except power</strong>, the
        revolutionary people reply.
